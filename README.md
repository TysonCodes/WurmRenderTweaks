# Client Render Tweaks for Wurm Unlimited

## Requirements
* Requires [Ago1024's client modloader](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmClientModLauncher/releases/latest) on the client.

## Installation
* Download ClientRenderTweaks.zip
* Extract ClientRenderTweaks.zip into wurm unlimited client folder 
(for example, C:/Program Files/SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/Wurm Unlimited/WurmLauncher). 
The ClientRenderTweaks.jar file should end up in mods/ClientRenderTweaks/ClientRenderTweaks.jar.
* Startup
  * Start the Wurm Client from Steam and enjoy!

## Background
This was done because on my solo-server I didn't want to have to deal with low visibility when I was trying to sculpt 
terrain and I don't like running as a GM. The grass/tree toggles are useful for finding arrows, etc. Personally this was 
'not fun' for me although I can see other people feeling it makes the game too easy. The great thing about mods is you
can install only the ones you want. :smile:

## Effects
* Adds 3 commands to the console window (F1):
  * 'weather' - Works the same as if you are a GM. Brings up a window (separate in Windows, not inside the game window) which lets you modify the time, rain, fog, etc.
  * 'toggleGrass' - Turns rendering of grass on/off. Makes it much easier to find things that are dropped on the ground in tall grass.
  * 'toggleTrees' - Turns rendering of trees on/off. Same as grass but affects trees/bushes instead.
